## 🚨 COMMON FIRST-TIME MISTAKES TO AVOID

### ❌ DON'T:

- Don't answer phone without pen and paper ready
- Don't forget to ask for reviews after EVERY job
- Don't try to do everything - focus on decluttering/cleanout first

### ✅ DO:
- Answer phone professionally EVERY time
- Take before/after photos of EVERY job
- Ask for Google reviews within 24 hours of completion
- Text customers confirmation immediately
- Show up on time (or early)
- Under-promise, over-deliver on first jobs
- Offer "first customer discount" if needed to close deals

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Tip #1: Answer Fast = Win Business
In garage decluttering, the first company to answer wins the job. Set up call forwarding, enable voicemail-to-text, answer within 5 minutes or lose the customer.

### Tip #2: Same-Day = Premium Pricing
If someone needs it TODAY, you can charge 20-30% more. Always ask "When do you need this done?" first.

### Tip #3: Before/After Photos = Free Marketing
Every job you do becomes marketing material. Take LOTS of photos. Post everywhere.

### Tip #4: Referrals = Free Customers
After EVERY job, say: "If you know anyone else who needs their garage done, we give $25 off for referrals!" You'll get 30% of customers referring friends.

### Tip #5: Calgary Winters = Busy Season
September-November is PEAK season (everyone wants to park inside before winter). December-February is slower but charge more for winter work.
