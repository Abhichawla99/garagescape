## 🚀 **LAUNCH STRATEGY:**

### **If You Have 0 Images Right Now:**
✅ **Just launch anyway!** The phone number is what matters!

Seriously - most people calling garage services don't care about photos. They care about:
1. Can you come today? ✅
2. What's the price? ✅
3. Do you serve my area? ✅

All of that is in the TEXT, not the images.

### **After Your First Job:**
1. Take TONS of photos (before, during, after)
2. These become your best marketing
3. Replace stock photos with real ones
4. Watch conversions increase!
